House Price Prediction 

My goal for this project is to build an end to end solution or application that is capable of predicting the house prices better than individuals.

I've built models to predict house prices in California using California Census data which consist of metrics such as population, median income,
median house price and others for each block group in California which typically consists of population from 600 too 3,000. 
The ultimate goal of the project is to build a prediction engine capable of predicting districtâ€™s median housing price.
